## Project 1 : Classical ML Vs Neural Networks - Trade-Off Analysis

Independent Data Science Project | Completed: August 2025
Link to notebook: [Sentiment Prediction](https://github.com/christina3099/Sentiment-Analysis)

### Overview: 
  * Implemented in Python using the TensorFlow (Keras) framework.
  * Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  * Built an end-to-end pipeline to experiment with multiple models.
  * Compared model performance using accuracy, F1-score, and training time.
  * Conducted a trade-off analysis to evaluate efficiency and practicality.

### Background: 
With the rapid rise of neural networks and large language models (LLMs), there is a growing trend to apply these complex architectures to every business problem. However, not all problems require such resource-heavy solutions. Many can still be effectively solved using classical machine learning models, which are often faster, more cost-efficient, and easier to deploy.

This project demonstrates the efficiency gap between classical regression models and neural network architectures (RNN, LSTM). The comparison highlights when it makes sense to opt for simpler methods versus more complex ones, providing insights into balancing accuracy, performance, and resource usage.

The following performance comparison chart illustrates model outcomes under identical input conditions based on accuracy and computation time.

### Key Takeaways

* Classical ML models remain highly effective for structured and smaller-scale datasets, offering faster training and lower costs.
* Neural networks deliver stronger performance on complex, sequential, or large-scale data but demand greater resources and longer training times.
* The optimal choice depends on the business context - prioritizing speed and cost-efficiency vs. accuracy and scalability.
